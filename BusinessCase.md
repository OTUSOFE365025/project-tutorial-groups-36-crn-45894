# Business Case

Universities rely on multiple digital systems to manage academic and administrative information, but these systems often do not provide a conversational interface for interacting with data through natural-language queries. As a result, students, lecturers, and administrators must navigate several tools to perform tasks, which can slow access to important information.

To address this challenge, the AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is proposed. AIDAP serves as a unified interface that connects with all key university systems, including LMS, registration, calendars, and email. Using standard APIs, the platform ensures interoperability across university systems while providing a conversational interface that allows users to access academic information and perform common tasks using natural language rather than navigating multiple applications. AIDAP is designed to improve efficiency, streamline communication, and provide personalized, real-time support for all stakeholders.

The platform achieves these goals by integrating securely with institutional systems, storing interaction histories for personalization, supporting multilingual queries, and authenticating users through single sign-on. Students can access personalized dashboards, notifications, and academic information, while lecturers can manage course materials, post announcements, and view aggregated teaching analytics. Administrators can oversee system integrations, define policies, broadcast campus-wide communications, and monitor usage, while system maintainers handle deployment, updates, monitoring, and backups. By fulfilling these requirements, AIDAP delivers a scalable, secure, and interoperable conversational interface that improves access to institutional data and services for all users.
