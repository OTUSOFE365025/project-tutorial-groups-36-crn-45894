# Business Case

The university relied on multiple separate systems for academic records, course materials, scheduling, and institutional communication. As these systems operated independently, students, faculty, and administrators frequently had difficulty locating information and completing routine academic tasks efficiently. To address this issue, the university initiated the development of the **AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)**. The system provides a conversational interface that allows users to request academic information and perform common tasks using natural language rather than navigating multiple applications. AIDAP retrieves data from existing institutional systems and presents it in a context-appropriate form, supporting activities such as accessing course schedules, viewing deadlines, publishing announcements, and retrieving academic summaries. By shifting from manual system navigation to AI-driven assistance, the platform is intended to improve communication efficiency, reduce administrative workload, and provide more accessible access to academic information for all university stakeholders.
