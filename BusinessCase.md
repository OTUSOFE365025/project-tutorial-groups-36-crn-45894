# Business Case

The university currently relies on multiple separate platforms for academic records, course materials, communication, and scheduling. Because these systems operate independently, students, lecturers, administrators, and system maintainers must switch between different interfaces to complete everyday academic tasks. This results in duplicated effort, difficulty locating information, inconsistent communication, and increased administrative workload.

To address these challenges, the institution is developing the **Academic Integrated Data and Analytics Platform (AIDAP)**. AIDAP does not replace existing systems; instead, it integrates them into a single unified interface. Students can query academic information, view academic summaries, and export personalized academic calendars. Lecturers can publish announcements and update course materials to support teaching. Administrators can issue broader institutional communications and manage system-level configurations. System maintainers can configure AI-related system behavior, maintain backups, and detect faults to ensure stable system performance.

By centralizing these academic workflows, AIDAP reduces time spent navigating multiple tools, improves consistency in communication, and provides reliable access to institutional data. The platform enhances efficiency for all users, supports instructional quality and student success, and improves operational reliability through integrated monitoring and backup mechanisms. Overall, AIDAP enables a more coherent, responsive, and manageable digital academic environment while maintaining compatibility with the universityâ€™s existing infrastructure.
